// Write a JS function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. 
// In other words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the 
// given array of numbers. Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest 
// one is ignored, alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest 
// one you set it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number. 
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
