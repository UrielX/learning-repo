# Your program should have two classes â€“ Books and GoldenEditionBooks.
# Book - represents a book that holds title, author and price. 
# A book should offer information about itself in the format shown in the output below.
# GoldenEditionBook - represents a special book that holds the same properties 
# as any Book, but its price is always 30% higher.
