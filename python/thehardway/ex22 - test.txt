I. Write every word and symbol that I've used in the previous exercises:
II. After every word and symbol write a name and a description of what it does:
List: 
1. mkdir - creates a folder on the HDD of the OS
2. cd something - open a folder on the HDD 
3. cd .. - goes back one folder
4. dir - lists the contents of the selected folder
5. () parenthesis - used after a function. When left blank it will use the default settings of the function, or it can be used to set arguments to a function
6. "" or '' double or single quotation marks - defines parts of a string
7. string - module that contains a numbers of constants and classes, used to I/O a set of characters, displays text or exports information out of the program
8. print("") - displays tha characters written in the ("")
9. # - Stops(ignores) a line or segment of code from being read by Python, it's used to add developer notes in code
10. + plus - math addition
11. - minus - math subtraction
12. / slash - math division
13. * asterisk - math multiplication
14. % percent - math percentage or modulus (X divided by Y with J remaining)
15. < less-than - compares a smaller number with a bigger number
16. > greater-thant - compares a bigger number with a smaller number
17. <= less-than-equal - compares a smaller number with a bigger number or checks if they are equal
18. >= greater-than-equal - compares a bigger number with a smaller number or checks if they are equal
19. = equal - can be used to define a variable, provide data, or be used in mathematical operations/formulas
20. == double-equal - tests whether two things have the same value
21. _ underscore - connects two separate words, e.g. cat_milk
22. {} curvy parenthesis - imbeds a variable inside a string
23. f"" formatting - tells python to read the {} symbol inside of a string as a variable 
24. .format() - another way to format a variable
25. round() - function that rounds a number
26. int() - tells python that the data should be read as an integer number
27. float() - tells python that the data should be read as a floating number
28. 
III. After list is done, spend couple of days rewriting and double-checking that it's correct. Also memorize it.
IV. After I've memorized the list make a table of symbols and their names
